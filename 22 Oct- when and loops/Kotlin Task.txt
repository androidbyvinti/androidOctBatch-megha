10. Now I want to improve the functionality of the “Insurance Premium Calculation program”. Take the input of user details like name, gender, city and age, until user enters “No”. If user enters ‘No’, then exit from the loop, else continue in the loop. Take input again and check if eligibility for the insurance is there or not , also count how many users are eligible and how many are not.
